# earmarks
This dataset and accompanying code for creating the data set were to be used for a research project on earmarks. However, due to time limitations I don't think I'll have time to go forward with it. I'm leaving the dataset up here in case it's useful to anyone. The code has comments about where all of the data comes from before I merged it into one dataset. 

The data comes from three sources. General earmark data from bipartisan policy center: https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/congressionally-directed-spending-fy2022-dataset/. Other data on legislators from the center for effective lawmaking: https://thelawmakers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CELHouse117LES2.xls (house data) and https://thelawmakers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CELSenate117LES2.xls (senate data). Finally, data on committee membership from https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators (the @unitedstates project, https://theunitedstates.io/, an open-source project with data on legislators and committees as well as various other US government subjects)

There's a dashboard with some figures here: https://gregsasso.shinyapps.io/earmarks_dashboard/

I'll update the readme as I have time with more information on variables.
