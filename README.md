# earmarks
This dataset and accompanying code for creating the data set were to be used for a research project on earmarks. However, due to time limitations I don't think I'll have time to go forward with it. I'm leaving the dataset up here in case it's useful to anyone. The code has comments about where all of the data comes from before I merged it into one dataset. I'll update the readme as I have time with more information on variables and data sources.
